Museum of Photography, Thessaloniki is located in Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, Greece. The museum was founded in 1987 by Aris Georgiou, Apostolos Maroulis and Yiannis Vanidis but it wasn't until 1997 that it was legally established and until 1998 that it opened with Giorgos Makris as its president and Aris Georgiou as its first director. It is currently housed in Warehouse 1 of the harbor of Thessaloniki, next to the Thessaloniki Cinema Museum.
 The museum’s mission is to collect photographs, especially historical and artistic photographs of Greece, to organize exhibitions and events to show the museum’s collection, to join forces with other similar bodies and work together and to publish books on photography.
