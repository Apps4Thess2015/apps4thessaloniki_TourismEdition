The White Tower of Thessaloniki (Ladino: Kuli Blanka, Greek: Λευκός
Πύργος Lefkos Pyrgos, Turkish: Beyaz Kule), is a monument and museum on the
waterfront of the city of Thessaloniki, capital of the region of Macedoniain
northern Greece. The present tower replaced an old Byzantine fortification which was
mentioned around the 15th century and reconstructed by the Ottomans to fortify the
city's harbour; it became a notorious prison and scene of mass executions during the
period of Ottoman rule. It was substantially remodeled and its exterior was
whitewashed after Greece gained control of the city in 1912. It has been adopted as
the symbol of the city. It has 6 floors, 34m height, 70m perimeter.
